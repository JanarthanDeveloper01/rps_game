 # Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in Python
This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Python where the user plays against the computer (Python). It's a console-based project perfect for beginners to understand input/output, random module usage, enums, and control flow in Python.

How It Works

The player is prompted to enter:

1 for Rock

2 for Paper

3 for Scissors

The computer randomly chooses one of the options.

The winner is determined based on the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:

Rock beats Scissors

Paper beats Rock

Scissors beats Paper

The result is displayed with a message indicating if it's a win, loss, or a tie
